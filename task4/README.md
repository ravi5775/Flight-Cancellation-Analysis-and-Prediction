Task 4

Classification Modeling, Evaluation & Result Interpretation

Background Information

In this task, explore multiple classification models to improve the accuracy of predicting flight cancellations. After training a Logistic Regression model, experiment with other algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Each model will be evaluated on the same test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The goal is to compare the performance of different models and select the best one for the task. This process helps identify the most suitable algorithm for real-world applications and enhances model performance through comparison.

Task Information

Choose Models:
Pick at least two other classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine).
Train and Evaluate:
Train each model using the same training set from Task 3.
Evaluate each model on the test set using the same metrics.
Compare Models:
Create a table or chart comparing the performance of all the models.
Discuss the pros and cons of each model. Which one is most accurate? Which one is easiest to understand or explain?
Choose the Best Model:
Based on your analysis, decide which model you would recommend for predicting flight cancellations. Explain your reasoning.
