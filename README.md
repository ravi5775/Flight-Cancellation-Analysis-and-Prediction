The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Flight_ID (Numeric):** Unique identifier for each flight (not used for modeling).  
- **Airline (Categorical):** Airline operating the flight (5 different airlines).  
- **Flight_Distance (Numeric):** Distance of flight in kilometers (standardized).  
- **Origin_Airport & Destination_Airport (Categorical):** Airports of departure and arrival (5 airports each).  
- **Scheduled_Departure_Time (Numeric):** Minutes past midnight when flight departs.  
- **Day_of_Week (Numeric):** Day flight is scheduled (1=Monday to 7=Sunday).  
- **Month (Numeric):** Month of the year (1=Jan to 12=Dec).  
- **Airplane_Type (Categorical):** Model/type of airplane (5 types).  
- **Weather_Score (Numeric):** Severity score of weather conditions.  
- **Previous_Flight_Delay_Minutes (Numeric):** Delay of previous flight by same airplane.  
- **Airline_Rating (Numeric):** Quality/reputation score of airline.  
- **Passenger_Load (Numeric):** Flight load percentage.  
- **Flight_Cancelled (Binary):** Target variable, 1 = cancelled, 0 = not cancelled.
