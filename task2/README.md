Exploratory Data Analysis & Insights Generation

Background Information

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics and uncover underlying patterns. In this task, you will use statistical methods and visualizations to explore the flight cancellation dataset, examining feature distributions, correlations, and relationships. The goal is to identify trends, detect anomalies, and gain insights that will inform further analysis and model development. EDA helps in understanding the data's structure and how features relate to the target variable, flight cancellations.

Task Information

Perform an EDA on the dataset to understand the data better and extract insights. This may involve:

Descriptive Statistics: Use the appropriate function to
